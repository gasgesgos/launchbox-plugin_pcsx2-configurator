PCSX2 Configurator v0.9

This is a configuration plugin for games being run in PCSX2, allowing the user to configure custom per-game configs from right within Launchbox.
Click this option on a chosen game to create a custom game config (if one doesn't already exist), and configure pcsx2 settings for only that game.
Each game also creates it's own custom memory card (slot 1), with a shared memory card being in memory card slot 2, all files and settings are stored
in the PCSX2 emulator path.
